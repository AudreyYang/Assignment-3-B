# Assignment-3-B

In this assignment, you will revisit the World Bank dataset we worked with in class to further familiarize yourself with the visualization pipeline as it is implemented in d3. You will practice parsing datasets with incomplete and potentially invalid data; setting scales; drawing axes; and experimenting with different representation strategies for the same data.
